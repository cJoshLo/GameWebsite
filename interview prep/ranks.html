	<h1>Rank System</h1>

	There are 8 main ranks in Valorant and they are all broken into three tiers, tier 1,tier 2, and tier 3. With tier 3 being the highest and closest to the next rank.
	<br>
	 This holds true for all ranks except the higest rank, Radiant. Radiant only has one tier and contains the top 0.000001% of players. 
	<br>
	Below is an image of all the ranks.
